    "    2. Consider the class distribution\n",
    "        - If the classes are balanced, accuracy can be a good metric to evaluate the model performance.\n",
    "        - However, if the class distribution is imbalanced, accuracy can be misleading.\n",
    "        - Other metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC can provide more insights into the model performance.\n",
    "        #\n",
    "    3. Analyze the business requirements\n",
    "        - The best metric to use may also depend on the business requirements or constraints.\n",
    "        - For example, in fraud detection, we may want to optimize for recall to catch as many fraudulent cases as possible, even at the cost of more false positives.\n",
    "        #\n",
    "    4. Consider the model's interpretability\n",
    "        - Some metrics like accuracy are straightforward to understand, while others like AUC or F1-score may require more explanation to stakeholders.\n",
    "        - If interpretability is crucial, simpler metrics like accuracy, precision, or recall may be better suited."
